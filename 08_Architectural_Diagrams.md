# Architectural Diagrams

## System Architecture Overview

The Friendly Whisper platform implements a comprehensive three-tier architecture designed specifically for healthcare environments. The presentation layer consists of React-based web applications and voice interfaces that provide clinicians with intuitive access to patient information and AI analytics. The application layer features a FastAPI backend server that orchestrates data flows between clinical systems, processes voice commands through natural language processing engines, and executes real-time AI analytics for risk assessment and predictive insights. The data layer integrates seamlessly with existing EMR systems, medical devices, and Cisco infrastructure components to provide a unified view of patient information and network intelligence.

## Data Flow Architecture

Patient data flows through the system in real-time, beginning with location detection through Cisco DNA Spaces when clinicians enter patient rooms. The system automatically retrieves patient context from EMR systems, processes the information through AI analytics engines to calculate risk scores and generate clinical insights, and delivers personalized patient summaries through voice synthesis technology. Network intelligence from Cisco ISE and infrastructure monitoring provides additional context about device connectivity, security status, and communication quality to ensure reliable clinical application performance.

## Network Topology Integration

The platform leverages existing hospital network infrastructure, integrating with Cisco core switches, access points, and security appliances to provide comprehensive visibility and control. DNA Spaces location services utilize Wi-Fi access points and BLE beacons for precise indoor positioning, while ISE policy engines ensure secure access to patient information based on user roles and device authentication. Webex Voice integration provides high-quality audio delivery through the hospital's unified communications infrastructure, enabling hands-free clinical workflows and seamless care team communication.

## Security and Authentication Flow

Security architecture implements zero-trust principles with multi-factor authentication, device certification, and continuous monitoring. All patient data access requires authenticated user sessions with role-based permissions, while medical devices undergo continuous security assessment through ISE policy enforcement. Voice commands and patient information are encrypted end-to-end, with audit trails maintained for regulatory compliance and security monitoring.
