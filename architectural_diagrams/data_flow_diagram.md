# Data Flow Diagram

## Patient Context Retrieval Flow

### Step 1: Location Detection
- Clinician enters patient room
- Cisco DNA Spaces detects location via Wi-Fi triangulation
- System identifies patient assignment and room context

### Step 2: Authentication and Authorization
- ISE authenticates user device and credentials
- Role-based access control determines data permissions
- Security policies enforce HIPAA compliance

### Step 3: Data Aggregation
- EMR system query for patient demographics and medical history
- Real-time vital signs from monitoring devices
- Medication orders and allergy information from pharmacy systems
- Recent clinical notes and care team communications

### Step 4: AI Processing
- Risk assessment algorithms analyze patient data
- Sepsis, fall risk, and deterioration probability calculations
- Predictive analytics for discharge planning and care optimization
- Natural language generation for patient summary

### Step 5: Voice Delivery
- Webex Voice processes audio output with healthcare-specific features
- Text-to-speech synthesis with medical terminology optimization
- Hands-free delivery with whisper mode for sensitive environments
- Real-time audio quality monitoring and optimization

### Step 6: Documentation and Audit
- Automatic logging of all data access and voice interactions
- Audit trail maintenance for regulatory compliance
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Continuous system optimization based on usage patterns
