# Security and Authentication Architecture

## Zero Trust Security Framework

### Identity and Access Management
- Multi-factor authentication for all clinical users
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration with hospital identity systems
- Continuous identity verification and risk assessment

### Device Security and Authentication
- ISE-based device profiling and authentication
- Certificate-based authentication for medical devices
- Continuous device monitoring and compliance assessment
- Automated quarantine for non-compliant or compromised devices

### Data Protection and Encryption
- End-to-end encryption for all patient data transmission
- Data encryption at rest with healthcare-grade security
- Secure key management and rotation policies
- HIPAA-compliant data handling and storage

### Network Security
- Network segmentation with micro-segmentation capabilities
- Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Real-time threat monitoring and automated response
- Security information and event management (SIEM) integration

### Compliance and Audit
- Comprehensive audit logging for all system interactions
- Automated compliance monitoring and reporting
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Incident response procedures and forensic capabilities

### Voice and Communication Security
- Encrypted voice communication channels
- Secure audio processing and storage
- Privacy protection for sensitive patient conversations
- Compliance with healthcare communication regulations
